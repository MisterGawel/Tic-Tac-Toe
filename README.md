# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a C++ implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game features a console-based interface and allows player and computer to compete against each other.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile the code, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as g++. From the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the source code files (tictactoe.cpp) and execute the following command:

```bash
g++ -o tictactoe.exe tictactoe.cpp
```

This will compile the code and generate an executable file named tictactoe.exe. You can then run the executable to start the game:

```bash
./tictactoe.exe
```

## How to Play

The game follows the standard rules of Tic-Tac-Toe. Players take turns marking empty cells in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three consecutive marks (X or O).

To select a cell to place your mark, enter the row and column numbers when prompted.
